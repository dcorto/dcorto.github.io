I had the pleasure of working with David at TwoNav. He is always ready to help and his deep technical expertise makes everything way easier. He is a great colleague and promotes teamworking. The perfect professional role model. His ability to take complex technical issues and break them down for even the most junior programmers is outstanding. Combine that with his passion and his eye for detail and he can fix just about anyone complicated tasks. It was a pleasure to work with David and I hope that we can work directly together again.
