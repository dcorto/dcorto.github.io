I worked with David a few years ago at Pin Digital. He's a very hard worker guy who implicates a lot in the work he has on him. I know very few people with his initiative to expand his knowledge and his capacity to help the others when they need it. That's why he is a magnificent co-worker and an inspirational team member who you won't regret to include in your team
