David is an excellent full-stack programmer, as well as a very good leader. The way he can archive a solution for a complex problem, makes you realize that you still have to learn a lot more. I personally learnt a lot of amazing stuff from him, and I'm so happy because we taught each other, and that's fantastic for us. He constantly makes the effort for being a team-player, attending all the requirements and proposing new solutions, that can make the business work better than it did before.
