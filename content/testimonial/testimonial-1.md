David displays high levels of energy and involvement in everything he does. I can affirm that with him on your team you can face insurmountable challenges. His curiosity knows no limits and it has helped me to discover high risk elements in my project with him which may have gone unseen. I can say with confidence that he demonstrated excellent knowledge of PHP, CSS, HTML5 and Symfony2 Framework. David also shows great skills about project management and leadership doing the right questions on the right moments over the project development. He loves to take initiatives and does not wait for the instructions. He fosters team spirit and works with the team for achieving results. Definitely he is an asset for any team.
